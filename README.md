A Composer package used to create new projects based on various project templates.
All project templates are distributed as separate Composer packages. The Project Builder
comes with a powerful configuration and templating system that allows to develop new
project templates in a very flexible way.

By simply using the Composer command [`create-project`][1] it was never easier to create
new project repositories from command line.

## üöÄ Features

* Kickstarter package for new projects
* Easily extensible for new project templates
* Support for private templates via Composer registry or VCS repository
* Modern configuration and templating system

## ‚ö° Usage

Usage with [Composer][2]:

```bash
composer create-project cpsit/project-builder <projectname>
```

Alternative usage with Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v <target-dir>:/app cpsit/project-builder
```

Please have a look at [`Usage`](docs/usage.md) for an extended overview.
